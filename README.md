# Smartcontract
1) This is my first smart contract where I have deployed the Greeter contract.

2) My second contract (Token.sol) is launching an ERC-20 token testing the function such as mint, burn and fixing supply of the token.

3) Third contract (Ownabletoken.sol) further expands on the second contract where I have tested the function of transferring ownership to another wallet.
