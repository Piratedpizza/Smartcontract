# Smartcontract
1) I have deployed 3 smart contracts on Ropsten network.

2) The first smart contract is simple Greeter.sol in which I try to establish connection with my friends.

3) My second contract (Token.sol) is launching an ERC-20 token testing the function such as mint, burn and fixing supply of the token.

4) Third contract (Ownableloca.sol) further expands on the second contract where I have tested the function of transferring ownership to another wallet.
